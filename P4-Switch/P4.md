# Programmable Switch

- This is a cheat sheet for Barefoot Tofino switch, especially Wedge 100B.
- It contains ONL installation, SDE installation, P4 program compiling and P4 program configuration.

## Switch OS Installation

- We take ONL installation on Wedge 100B as an example in this document.
- You should follow the instructions below.

### Download ONL and Compile

- SDE 9.3.0 or other later versions require to install ONL source code from GitHub, apply a patch for BFSDE and compile.
  - The original compilation script uses docker, but it requires stable internet connection to GitHub. As a result, if your server locates in China Mainland, it is complicated to compile.
  - We provide a pre-compiled binary image of ONL, corresponding to SDE 9.4.0.
- Open-sourced ONL can be downloaded at [GitHub](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/OpenNetworkLinux), and official patch can be downloaded at [Intel Support](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/secure/design/confidential/products-and-solutions/networking-and-io/programmable-ethernet-switch-products/p4-suite/p4-studio.html?wapkw=p4+studio&s=Newest). (License required)
- If you are at Peking University, you can download our pre-compiled ONL at [NextCloud](http://p40.server.zhengnq.com:8080/s/d4nBbqy2R2eL3rX). After that, you should also download onl kernel deb file at [NextCloud](http://p40.server.zhengnq.com:8080/s/Wwwq6mgYZmSYGgP).

### Install ONL

- Connect to switch via console port.
- Restart switch, and log into BMC.
  - User: root
  - Password: 0penBmc
- `wedge_power.sh reset` to reset main CPU.
- `sol.sh` to connect to main CPU via console.
- Log into ONIE, and upload ONL binary image.
- `onie-nos-install <ONL image>`

### Install Dependencies on ONL

- Install kernel patch downloaded before.
  - `dpkg -i  <kernel patch>`
- Download dependencies and install them.
  - Dependencies are listed in `ONL_<version>_patch_and_install_scripts.zip`, which can be downloaded from [Intel Support](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/secure/design/confidential/products-and-solutions/networking-and-io/programmable-ethernet-switch-products/p4-suite/p4-studio.html?wapkw=p4+studio&s=Newest). (License required)
  - If you are at Peking University, you can download all dependencies from [NextCloud](http://p40.server.zhengnq.com:8080/s/jXQN9a6ec7CLGHX).
    - `install.sh` helps you to install these dependencies automatically.

### Install SDE

- You can download SDE and BSP from [Intel Support](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/secure/design/confidential/products-and-solutions/networking-and-io/programmable-ethernet-switch-products/p4-suite/p4-studio.html?wapkw=p4+studio&s=Newest). (License required)

- After that, you should set up environmental variables as follow,

  - ```
    export SDE=<location of SDE>
    export SDE_INSTALL=$SDE/install
    export BSP=<location of BSP>
    export BSP_INSTALL=$SDE_INSTALL
    ```

- Use `p4studio_build.py` to build SDE as follow,

  - ```
    cd $SDE/p4studio_build
    ./p4studio_build.py --use-profile switch_p416_profile --bsp-path $BSP
    ```

- Build BSP

  - ```
    cd $BSP
    ./configure --prefix=$BSP_INSTALL -enable-thrift
    make -j
    make install
    ```

### Load Tofino Kernel Mode Driver

- Load drivers

  - ```
    cd $SDE
    sudo ./install/bin/bf_kdrv_mod_load $SDE_INSTALL
    ```

- The kernel driver needs to be loaded every time the CPU is rebooted. Also, when there is an upgraded SDE, the kernel driver needs to be unloaded using the following steps,

  - ```
    cd $SDE
    sudo ./install/bin/bf_kdrv_mod_unload
    ```

- Set HugePages

  - ```
    $SDE_INSTALL/bin/dma_setup.sh
    ```
